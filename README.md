# A02 - Internal Memory Management in GCC During Compilation

This repository documents the research into GCC's memory allocation strategies, including GGC (Garbage Collection), Obstacks, and memory pools.

## Project Deliverables

All documentation is available in **PDF** (formatted) and **Markdown** (source text) formats.

### 1. Research Report
**[📄 Read the Final Report (PDF)](report.pdf)**
* *[Source Markdown: report.md](report.md)*

A comprehensive analysis of how GCC manages memory from the Front End (Parsing) through to the Back End (RTL generation), focusing on performance and modularity.

### 2. Verification & Methodology
* **[PDF Version](verification.pdf)** | **[Markdown Version](verification.md)**

A cross-referencing document detailing how the AI's claims were verified against the GCC source code to ensure accuracy.

### 3. Prompt Engineering Log
* **[PDF Version](prompts.pdf)** | **[Markdown Version](prompts.md)**

A complete record of the specific prompts used to generate the analysis, including the refinement steps taken to correct initial hallucinations.
