# A02 - Internal Memory Management in GCC During Compilation

This repository documents the research into GCC's memory allocation strategies, including GGC (Garbage Collection), Obstacks, and memory pools.

## Project Deliverables

### 1. [Research Report](report.md)
A comprehensive analysis of how GCC manages memory from the Front End (Parsing) through to the Back End (RTL generation), focusing on performance and modularity.

### 2. [Prompt Engineering Log](prompts.md)
A documentation of the specific prompts used with the AI model to generate the technical analysis.

### 3. [Verification & Methodology](verification.md)
A cross-referencing document detailing how the AI's claims were verified against the GCC source code and official documentation to ensure accuracy.
